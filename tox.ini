# How this works:
#   This environment runs the default ``tox`` invocation (testing the
#   environments specified in ``envlist`` above), passing the environmnt
#   variables necessary to trigger recreation of the test environment
#   and installation of ``requireemnts_unfrozen.txt`` rather than
#   ``requirements.txt``. Because the environment is fresh, the most
#   recent packages allowed by ``requirements_unfrozen.txt`` will be
#   installed. If tests succeed with these requirements, the tox command
#   is run again using the ``freeze_requirements`` environment, which
#   again creates a fresh virtual environment and installs packages from
#   ``requirements_unfrozen.txt``. The current environment is then frozen
#   and output to ``requirements.txt``.
